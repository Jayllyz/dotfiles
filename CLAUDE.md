## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY nontrivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and replan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

### 2. Subagent Strategy to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update 'tasks/lessons.md' with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- If a test suite is available, add a test that reproduces the bug before fixing it
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests -> then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to 'tasks/todo.md' with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review to 'tasks/todo.md'
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update 'tasks/lessons.md' after corrections

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry best practices. Suggest missing [skills](https://skills.sh/)/tools if needed.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

# Bash Guidelines

## Avoid commands that cause output buffering issues
- DO NOT pipe output through `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `more` when monitoring or checking command output
- DO NOT use `| head -n X` or `| tail -n X` to truncate output - these cause buffering problems
- Instead, let commands complete fully, or use `--max-lines` flags if the command supports them
- For log monitoring, prefer reading files directly rather than piping through filters

## When checking command output:
- Run commands directly without pipes when possible
- If you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g., `git log -n 10` instead of `git log | head -10`)
- Avoid chained pipes that can cause output to buffer indefinitely
